There are a couple of gotchas: the `.pydevproject` file is overwritten, the
proper way to do this would be to parse the xml file with something like minidom
and replace the nodes with the proper content.

At the moment the handling of the "source paths" is very shitty. I've tried to
fix it (but it stills fails for some of my projects), but I think it's a lot 
better to let Eclipse handle this part. I think the best way is to parse the 
.pydevproject file and write the node with the name
"org.python.pydev.PROJECT_EXTERNAL_SOURCE_PATH". This will solve all the issues
that I might have with this project. That and allowing additional paths to be
written in buildout as optionals that are not handled through the egg dependency
mechanism.
